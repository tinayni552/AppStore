    "After analyzing both the App Store and the Google Play Store, we concluded that we should develop an application that is suitable for both stores since there are some differences between the two stores. So we need to develop an application that is related to books and fun to be suitable for the App Store, and it should also be related to Photography to attract the users in the Google Store. So the app can be something that combines learning and photography. The app might have several games where the user is asked to photograph an item and guess its name in a foreign language that the user wants to learn. We think that this type of application would be successful in the free apps market since it would attract a lot of users."
